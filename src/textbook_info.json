      "segments": "Episode  1\nWhen the World Began...\n\nTime Span: 15,000 BC to 1800 AD\n\nThe opening episode of this 16-part documentary ranges across the continent, looking back more than 15,000 years to recount the varied history of the first occupants of the territory that would become Canada. From the rich resource of native oral history and archeology come the stories of the land's first people - how dozens of distinct societies took shape, and how they encountered a strange new people, the Europeans. Among the earliest of these epoch-making encounters is the meeting between Jacques Cartier and Donnacona, the Iroquoian chief whom Cartier first met on the Gasp\u00e9 shore in 1534 and later kidnapped. Later on the Pacific coast, Nootka chief Maquinna encounters John Jewitt, the English sailor who became his captive and eventually his reluctant friend.\n\nEpisode  2\nAdventurers and Mystics\n\nTime Span: 1540 To 1670\n\nWith the search for the Northwest Passage and the expansion of the Grand Banks fishery, the New World soon becomes a destination for permanent European colonies, in Newfoundland and along the St. Lawrence. Samuel de Champlain begins his legendary journeys, and the precarious beginnings of New France are established. It is an era of unprecedented alliances and devastating conflicts with native people, driven by the merchants' search for furs and the Jesuits' quest for souls. After a half-century of struggle, with the colony on the verge of extinction, Louis XIV takes personal control, sending French soldiers to defend the struggling outpost and eligible young women, the \"filles du roi,\" to become their wives.\n\nEpisode  3\nClaiming the Wilderness\n\nTime Span: 1670 To 1755\n\nA small French settlement in New France builds a flourishing society and stakes a claim to a massive continent between 1660 and 1750. New France's populace includes shop keepers, artisans, farmers and landlords, as well as fur-trading expansionists like Governor Frontenac and his commercial partner, Robert Cavelier de La Salle, who build a network of Indian alliances and extend French trading posts to the Gulf of Mexico. But this fast-paced growth brings New France into ever more bitter conflict with the wealthier and more numerous - but less venturesome - British colonists to the south. The story culminates with the heartrending deportation of more than 10,000 French Catholic Acadians as the struggle to possess North America enters its final, decisive phase.\n\nEpisode  4\nBattle for a Continent\n\nTime Span: 1754 To 1775\n\nA period of a little more than two decades in the mid-18th century changes the destiny of North America. England and France battle each other in the Seven Years' War, a conflict that begins as a clash between les Canadiens and land-hungry American settlers in the Ohio Valley and becomes a world war that engulfs the continent. Fortress Louisbourg, symbol of the French empire, is the target of 27,000 soldiers and sailors in the greatest naval invasion in North America's history. In 1759, General James Wolfe leads the assault against Quebec but the citadel withstands a devastating siege and bombardment. With winter soon arriving, Wolfe forces the commander of the French troops, Louis-Joseph de Montcalm, into one last desperate encounter. The battle for North America unfolds on an abandoned farmer's field, the Plains of Abraham, just outside the city's walls. When war ends in 1763, 70,000 French colonists come under British rule, setting in motion the ever-evolving French-English dynamic in Canada.\n\nEpisode  5\nA Question of Loyalties\n\nTime Span: 1775 To 1815\n\nAt the beginning of the American Revolution in 1775, American rebels invade Canada but despite the efforts of rebel spies to entice Quebec to join the revolution, les Canadiens refuse to take up arms against British rule, and the invasion ultimately fails. The mass migration of Loyalists that follows - more than 40,000 people in all - creates an English-speaking Canada virtually overnight. Over the next 30 years, the colony continues to develop. When the next American invaders arrive in 1812, they are fought to a stand-still at the battles of Queenston Heights, Chateauguay and Lundy's Lane, setting boundaries that remain today. The cast of characters includes the audacious military commanders General Isaac Brock and Colonel Charles-Michel de Salaberry; Hannah Ingraham and her dispossessed Loyalist family; Benedict Arnold, the notorious traitor to the American Revolution; visionary Indian leader Tecumseh; Pierre B\u00e9dard, brilliant tactician of an emerging colonial democracy; and Canadian traitors who are publicly executed near Hamilton, Ontario.\n\nEpisode  6\nThe Pathfinders\n\nTime Span: 1670 To 1850\n\nThe Canadian west is opened by the great fur-trading empires of the Hudson's Bay and Northwest Companies, the native people who were their indispensable allies, and bold explorers and map makers who ventured from the Great Lakes to the Arctic Ocean and long-sought-for Pacific. Pierre Esprit Radisson defies a governor to take New France's trade far into the continent's interior and later, founds an English trading empire; Pierre Gaultier de Varennes, sieur de la V\u00e9rendrye, spends a lifetime searching for the Western Sea and pays dearly for it. Tough Dene chief Matonabbee leads Samuel Hearne on a monumental trek into the Barren Lands; Alexander Mackenzie's dash to the Pacific makes him one of the most celebrated men of his age. And David Thompson comes to the forbidding shores of Hudson Bay as a 14-year-old apprentice and eventually unlocks the secrets of the West more than any other man. As the fur trader's day comes to an end, settlers on the prairies and gold miners in British Columbia begin to claim the west for themselves.\n\nEpisode  7\nRebellion and Reform\n\nTime Span: 1815 To 1850\n\nBy 1830, the struggle for democratic government in the colonies of British North America has reached fever pitch. As the colonies grow in wealth and population, a generation of charismatic reformers -- Joseph Howe in Nova Scotia, Louis-Joseph Papineau in Lower Canada and William Lyon Mackenzie in Upper Canada - confront the appointed governors and their local favourites with one demand: let the citizens' elected representatives run their own affairs. In the Canadas, the struggle leads to bloody rebellion and disastrous defeat for the rebels. Yet within 10 years, the prize of self-government is won, thanks in part to an unexpected alliance between the French and English-speaking forces of reform.\n\nEpisode  8\nThe Great Enterprise\n\nTime Span: 1850 To 1867\n\nIn a few short years, a handful of small and separate British colonies are transformed into a new nation that controls half the North American continent. The story of Confederation, its supporters and its bitter foes, is told against a backdrop of U.S. Civil War and Britain's growing determination to be rid of its expensive, ungrateful colonies. The dawn of the photographic era provides a vivid portrait of the diverse people who make up the new Dominion of Canada: the railway magnates, the unwed mothers of Montreal, the nuns who provide refuge for the destitute, the prosperous merchants of Halifax, the brave fugitives of the Underground Railroad, and the tide of Irish immigrants who flood into the cities.\n\nEpisode  9\nFrom Sea to Sea\n\nTime Span: 1867 To 1873\n\nConfederation is barely accomplished when the new dominion must face an enormous challenge: extending its reach into the vast prairies and beyond, to the Pacific Ocean. But Canada blunders catastrophically in seeking to take over the west without the consent of its inhabitants, especially the M\u00e9tis of Red River and their leader, the charismatic, troubled Louis Riel. The resistance of 1869-70 lays the groundwork for Manitoba to join Canada, but it also sets the stage for decades of conflict over the rights of French and English, Catholic and Protestant in the new territories. Thanks to an audacious promise of a transcontinental railway in 10 years, the settlers of British Columbia are more easily convinced of the merits of union; by 1873 Prince Edward Island has joined as well, and Canada can boast a dominion that extends from sea to sea.\n\nEpisode  10\nTaking the West\n\nTime Span: 1873 To 1896\n\nThe 1870s and 1880s are a time of trial for the young Dominion of Canada. The country's first Prime Minister, John A. Macdonald, faces economic depression in the fast-growing factories of the east and a new revolt in the west, led by his old nemesis, Louis Riel. The suppression of the Northwest Rebellion and Macdonald's single-minded insistence that the French-speaking Catholic Riel must hang for treason threatens to tear apart the fragile bond between Quebec and English Canada. During this same era, debates over provincial powers and the Manitoba Schools Question rage, and a dream is realized: the Canadian Pacific Railway links the country and opens the prairies to new floods of immigration.\n\nEpisode  11\nThe Great Transformation\n\nTime Span: 1896 To 1915\n\nMassive waves of immigration, a headlong economic boom with the growth of prairie agriculture and urban industry transform Canada between 1896 and 1915. Those who shape the new society include peasants from Eastern Europe, in search of free land; socialists who try to mobilize an emerging urban working class; and campaigners for temperance and women's suffrage. The dizzying pace of change also brings ethnic intolerance and racism, particularly against Asian immigrants. As well, growing tensions over Canada's role in the British Empire help put an end to Sir Wilfrid Laurier's reign in 1911. When World War I breaks out, a burst of enthusiasm in English Canada and resistance in French Canada foreshadows domestic conflict as wartime pressures grow.\n\nEpisode  12\nOrdeal by Fire\n\nTime Span: 1915 To 1929\n\nCanada's heavy military role in World War I (60,000 dead in a population of 8 million) transforms its society, its politics and its place in the world. The horror, bravery and sacrifice of trench warfare are evoked in Canada's great battles: Ypres, the Somme, Vimy Ridge, Courcelette and Passchendaele. The domestic consequences of Canada's war effort are also wrenching - the conscription crisis of 1917 marks a low point in English-French relations. After the war ends, labour revolts in Winnipeg and across the country raise fears of a Bolshevik insurrection. The return to stability in the mid-1920s lasts only briefly as the crash of 1929 plunges the country into economic chaos.\n\nEpisode  13\nHard Times\n\nTime Span: 1929 To 1940\n\nCanada's economy collapses during the 1930s, creating a prolonged political and social crisis. In the context of the Dust Bowl, the relief camps and the Regina Riot, political leaders such as William Aberhart, Maurice Duplessis, and Mitchell Hepburn capture national attention. Meanwhile, an increasingly menacing international climate sees the rise of fascism and mounting likelihood of another world war. When war does arrive, Canada finds itself fighting virtually alone at Britain's side.\n\nEpisode  14\nThe Crucible\n\nTime Span: 1940 To 1946\n\nCanada comes of age in the anguish of World War II, with soldiers on the beaches at Dieppe and women in the industrial work force back home. The country's military role and the domestic social and political consequences of the war are traced through poignant stories of Canadians on both sides of the Atlantic. The horrific global conflict steals the innocence of a generation... but brings hope for a new future.\n\nEpisode  15\nComfort and Fear\n\nTime Span: 1946 To 1964\n\nThe end of World War II signals the end of fifteen years of social, political and economic upheaval. The post-war baby boom and government economic and social policies give rise to unprecedented prosperity and growth for Canadian communities. Television becomes a powerful new tool with social and political consequences. But in the midst of plenty, growing fears of the Cold War and nuclear conflict create an unsettled atmosphere. Political leaders - including Diefenbaker, Smallwood, Duplessis create excitement and controversy. Saskatchewan's premier Tommy Douglas begins the fight for Medicare while Canada finds itself increasingly absorbed into the American military, economic and cultural orbit.\n\nEpisode  16\nYears of Hope and Anger\n\nTime Span: 1964 To 1976\n\nThe Sixties and Seventies are an era of ferment on every level: politics, culture and personal life. Quebec's Quiet Revolution and youth movements across North America challenge the status quo. Some events bring the country together: a new flag is introduced and Canada shines in the world's spotlight with Expo '67; while others threaten considerable upheaval: growing calls for Quebec sovereignty, the 1970 FLQ/War Measures Act crisis, and an energy shortage pits East against West. A charismatic law professor is elected Liberal leader, then Prime Minister; Trudeaumania changes the face of Canadian politics.\n\nEpisode  17\nIn an Uncertain World\n\nTime Span: 1976 To 1990\n\nThe world order and economic boom that had taken shape after World War II starts to unravel, and a new era of uncertainty begins. Free trade, globalization, and regionalism converge with the rise of feminism, aboriginal claims, growing multiculturalism and the explosion of computer technology. Canada's economic, social and political environment are affected. Canada's new Charter begins to have an impact. Debate around Canadian unity intensifies with the Quebec referendum of 1980, repatriation of the Constitution and the Meech Lake Accord.",

      "description": "This paper examines all aspects of homeland defense of the United States. First it provides a historical perspective on the Homeland Defense mission and identifies future threats. Each major threat area is then examined to determine what our response should be against that threat, to include identifying specific missions. Each mission is assessed for its compatibility with Active Duty Forces and with Reserve Component Forces using the criteria of trust of the American people, availability of personnel and equipment and the ability to adequately perform the mission. The similarities of the Active and Reserve capabilities along with their differences are compared to make an argument for the role each should play in providing a strong homeland defense for the United States of America. This paper finally recommends that the National Guard take the lead role in specific homeland defense missions, with follow on forces from the Reserve and Active Duty military services. The special relationship enjoyed with the civilian community by the reserve components should be used to leverage military support to civil authorities.",

      "description": "The end of the Cold War has presented the free world unique opportunities to create new order and security in Europe. The U.S. National Security Strategy advances the notion that global integration will bring stability and it advocates the use of military engagement activities to promote democracy and build relationships with nations that were once our former adversaries. Developing the trust and confidence of both political and military institutions are key to the promotion of democratic ideals. The National Guard's State Partnership Program is an engagement tool that exemplifies the democratic process through the citizen-soldier and their connection to the heart of America's communities. The involvement of the National Guard in helping new nations build democratic institutions is a sound concept that capitalizes on the strengths that Guard members bring through the combination of their military and civilian acquired skills. The reserve component model also offers emerging nations an economical alternative to more costly active forces and conveys a non-threatening defensive posture to their neighbors. The utility of reserve forces in providing military support to civil authorities during emergencies is another benefit demonstrated through partnership engagement activities. The military and civilian contacts conducted through the State Partnership Program offer great potential for building relationships that promote regional stability while providing the Guard opportunities for overseas deployments in a coalition environment. This paper will examine the California National Guard's partnership with Ukraine under the U.S. engagement strategy and the benefits associated with this national security objective.",

      "description": "The 1995 Oklahoma City bombing maximized America's awareness of its vulnerability to terrorist activities, and erased the nation's sense of security that terrorist attacks could not occur within the United States. As a result, the possibility of such bombings, to include weapons of mass destruction (WMD), could no longer be ignored. In May 1998, the president issued presidential Decision Directive (PDD) 62, which established policy and assigned responsibilities for responding to homeland attacks. It directed the Department of Justice (FBI) to assume the lead for such circumstances and it also identified the National Guard as playing an important role in this program. The National Guard established Civil Support Teams in each of the ten FEMA regions to assist state and local first responders in a WMD incident. In May 1999, a US General Accounting Office report on federal government efforts to combat terrorism indicated that the role of National Guard Civil Support Teams remained unclear and there is significant redundancy in response capabilities. This paper examines whether there is a continued need for the National Guard Civil Support Teams, and explains how they fit into Federal, State, and local response plans.",

If so, a major contributor to the unified cause was the Weekly Pantagraph, the hometown newspaper published in Bloomington. The so-called \"Radical Republican\" paper rallied its readers, railed at \"Copperhead\" dissenters, printed brilliant descriptions of battles in letters from the front, and did everything it could to win the war and free the slaves.\u00a0<br /><br />Here is a week-by-week sampling of America's most turbulent years, written as it happened, unaided by the benefit of historical perspective. It is how people near Bloomington, Illinois, experienced the days, weeks and years of the Civil War.<br /><br />Don Munson has been a radio professional for half the 80-year life of the medium. His morning wake-up program on Bloomington's WJBC earned America's highest audience share for much of the last third of the 20th century. The National Association of Broadcasters recognized Munson's contributions to radio by presenting him with the prestigious Marconi Award in 1991.

      "description": "The principle threat to the United States' national security has undergone a significant change. The dissolution of the Soviet Union has shattered the global balance of power and left the United States as the world's lone superpower. The threat facing our nation has shifted from a single, definable foe to one that is much less clear. The threat facing our nation today is characterized by terms such as homeland defense, rogue state, non-state actor, and Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD). This modern threat is terrorism within our nation's borders. Currently, the United States is not prepared to counteract this threat. While significant attention has been paid to the terrorist threat over the past five years, our nation's strategy for dealing with this danger is still unfocused and inefficient. Today, America's strategy to defeat terrorism is contingent on the participation of several different state, local and federal agencies. Due to civil liberty concerns, the nation's most qualified agency, the Department of Defense (DoD), plays only a minor role. More importantly, the U.S. Joint Forces Command (USJFCOM), which is assigned the responsibility of providing military assistance during homeland terrorist attacks, has an equally limited role in countering the terrorist threat. To improve our ability to counter this emerging threat, the United States must re-evaluate the way in which we deal with this threat and assign assets based on capability. In particular, our nation must amend the laws, which restrict Department of Defense's participation in homeland defense so that the U.S. Joint Forces Command is allowed to play a larger role in the Crisis and Consequence Management missions.",

      "description": "Much of what has been written about civil-military relations in the United States seems to be reactive to present and past events rather then proactive and forward looking. What needs to occur in order to gain a resolution of this problem is for a proactive assessment of where America's society and military need to balance in a future security environment. What this entails is to first survey the current model that most resembles where civil-military relations stand now. Essentially, an examination will show that the military still embraces Huntington, while in reality Janowitz's theories are proving themselves to be the more applicable and accurate of the two. Especially noteworthy is the destruction of Huntington's myth that only the military has the professional knowledge to become involved in the waging of war. Next, a comprehensive assessment of what the emerging security threats will be in the future is needed. The military will have to change many of the ways that it goes about business. The most fundamental impact on the future of civil-military relationships will be from the change in the role of the individual.",

      "description": "Plan Colombia, the $1.3 billion centerpiece of the United States' strategy for reducing America's illegal drug habits through source country supply reduction, is fundamentally flawed. It will not only fail to meet its primary objective of reducing drug abuse in the United States, but it will also have the undesirable effect of causing additional bloodshed abroad, by providing more fuel for a 37-year old civil war. The United States needs to look at alternative strategies focused on demand-side reduction through user accountability and education, if it is ever to minimize the negative effects of drug abuse at home. This essay will introduce the reader to Plan Colombia; discuss the U.S. national interests and the threats and opportunities that have led to U.S. involvement in Colombia; examine the basic concepts of the U.S. National Drug Control Strategy; and explore the history of the Colombian civil war. It will then discuss strengths and weaknesses of continued U.S. support of Plan Colombia, and present recommendations for alternative strategies.",

      "description": "The Corps of Engineers is an American institution, and work of the Mobile District represents only one chapter in a long and distinguished history. The Corps was founded in principle when the Continental Congress authorized the positions of engineer chief and two assistants. Along with his general military responsibilities on the eve of the American Revolution, George Washington was authorized to established the first engineer corps. Because of the lack of qualified American personnel, foreign expertise was sought from among America's allies. As a result of a diplomatic accord with France, numerous French military officers offered their services to General Washington. While the use of French military was well received, negative aspects would surface later. The Corps of Engineers was organized formally in 1779. The early years were unstable; the Corps was dissolved in 1783 only to be reactivated in 1794. Parallels can be drawn between the Corps' formative years and the history of the Mobile District. After each war in the United States, Congress and the public called for a major reduction in military strength and operations during peacetime. The waxing and waning of military responsibility is reflected in the operations of the Mobile District until the Korean War. Since the 1950's military and civil responsibilities have been carried out concurrently. From its inception, the Corps of Engineers has enjoyed privileged status as an elite engineer organization. Special duties of the Corps were described in a communication from Secretary of War James McHenry in 1800. He stated the services of the Army Engineer were not limited to constructing and repairing fortifications. McHenry went on to say that military service was but one, although important, facet of the engineer profession. Corps skills extended to almost every area of defense and to civil works including building roads, canals, and bridges.",

      "description": "Joint Doctrine dictates that we will train as we intend to fight. By staying trained and ready, our military is able to execute its constitutional responsibility of protecting America, its people, its borders, and its global interests. If the tragic events of September 11, 2001 are a sign of what's ahead, then the way we train must also focus on non-traditional threats at home. Most importantly, we must forge new training partnerships with local, state, and federal civilian responders in order to strengthen the civil-military seams in the effort to ensure domestic preparedness. The recent creation of the Office of Homeland Security and a new combatant command responsible for homeland defense, represent sweeping organizational changes in DoD and the federal government. These changes demand a new approach to training readiness as the military maps its doctrine tor civil support. The international security environment is fraught with many challenges. This paper examines existing response capabilities at the local, state, and federal levels to determine the adequacy of our current response mechanism. It explores the roles, missions, and functions of the key actors, while assessing the training programs at each level. The paper looks at current organizational structures and operational concepts for securing and defending the homeland at every level in order to ascertain whether existing response systems adequately prepare for the security challenges in the new environment. Finally, focusing on JFCOM's training support role, this paper will recommend a solution set where DoD assumes an expanded role to meet America's training requirements that helps synchronize national assets for homeland defense.",

      "description": "There is role for the Army in homeland security. That role is one of support to civil authorities at local, state, and federal levels. The events of 11 September 2001 were the catalyst to start a process of developing a formal approach to securing America's homeland. Trying to define what homeland security means to each agency and governmental entity is important to determine the security tasks the Army will support in this arena. Once the definitions are in place - Army forces, which can best support homeland security, more clearly fall out. In a likely outcome, the Army National Guard will assume the greatest share of the Army's contribution to domestic security. To do so the Army National Guard must change to assume the new role in homeland security. Currently, the Army National Guard is not able to meet the traditional role of supporting the active forces, as well as, fulfill the support role to civil authorities in homeland security. In the process of transformation by reducing support to the Active force and focusing on homeland security, the Army National Guard will optimize the Army's commitment in homeland security. Any change to the National Guard will take political action, which means, in the final analysis, politics will determine a final homeland security role for the Army.",

      "description": "In America today the dominant view of civil-military relations holds that civilian control of the military is dangerously eroded. Though tension clearly exists in the relationship, the current critique is largely inaccurate and badly overwrought. Far from overstepping its bounds, America's military operates comfortably within constitutional notions of separated powers, participating appropriately in defense and national security policymaking with due deference to the principle of civilian control. Indeed, an active and vigorous role by the military in the policy process is and always has been essential to the common defense. Today the subject of civil-military relations turns on two questions. The first is whether or not the American military has become dangerously estranged from American society at large. The second is whether or not it has become too deeply involved in American politics. Both are serious questions which deserve deeper examination than they generally receive. Civil-military relations in America today are unquestionably marked by friction, not between society and the military, but between civilian and military elites. There are two principal factors that explain the divide. The first is that discord between civilian and military elites springs primarily from social and intellectual differences that profoundly condition and shape the relationship. The second is that our system of constitutionally distributed control over the military ensures that the tension inherent in separated powers extends to the military domain. The tension which marks the civil-military relationship today is not a function of an overweening military. Instead it is a product of a uniquely American process of constitutional governance which has succeeded well in reconciling the competing imperatives of an effective national defense and a properly subordinated system of separated powers.",

      "description": "Americans consumed approximately 260 metric tons of cocaine and 13 metric tons of heroin at a cost of $45 billion in the year 2000. While estimates vary, most experts agree between 80-90 percent of the cocaine and more than 50 percent of the heroin used in the United States comes from Colombia. In terms of the total drug picture, it is estimated illegal drugs cost America approximately 52,000 lives and $110 billion a year. But America is not alone in feeling the pain brought on by the illicit Colombia drug trade. In Colombia, the $4 billion narcotics industry has heightened the effect of nearly 40 years of civil war, bringing with it overwhelming violence, a crisis in government, full-scale military battles between nonstate actors, and the potential for terrorists to use large portions of the country as a training and operational base in the Western Hemisphere. With approximately one million internally displaced persons within Colombia and an undetermined number more seeking refuge in Panama, Brazil, Ecuador, Peru, and Venezuela, the issue is no longer local in scope. A drug trade marriage of convenience between the narcotics traffickers, insurgents, and paramilitaries is threatening the Colombian government, impacting regional stability, and testing America's resolve to ensure hemispheric security and fight terrorism.",

Transformation, asymmetrical warfare, terrorism, scarce resources, civil-military gap-these are just a few examples of the myriad challenges facing the U.S. Armed Forces. Among the many areas of concern, the challenge of recruiting a quality force invariable floats to the top. U.S. National Security depends on an adequately trained, equipped, and manned force. Transitioning from a conscript Army to the all-volunteer force of 1973 put the Army squarely in the open market place for talent. No one foresaw the total implications of manning the force for 2010 when we made this decision. This Strategy Research Project proposes ways to increase the propensity of America's youth to serve in the Army. It offers suggestions for recruiting a quality force to serve the nation's 21st century defense needs.",

      "description": "Latin America has historically been a region of instability and turmoil. It is known for institutional corruption, weak economies, abject poverty, extensive underemployment as well as unemployment, overpopulation, social discord, non-democratic governments, military involvement in civil affairs, human rights abuses, weapons proliferation, drug cartels and narco-terrorism. Additionally, Colombia's continued insurgency significantly exasperates the situation. The arrival of Islamic extremists and transnational terrorists can only increase the problems of the region and directly threaten the security of the United States as well as America's partners. The presence of militant extremist groups like Hamas, Hizballah and al- Qaida in the triborder area (TBA) of Paraguay, Argentina and Brazil is a matter of serious concern. The Combatant Commander's TSCSG is a theater strategic planning document that is key in shaping, responding and preparing the region for security cooperation and peacetime engagement.

      "description": "The United States involvement in military operations around the world has operational commanders on the front line against asymmetrical threats, be it from state or nonstate actors. In Somalia US soldiers were exposed to mortar attacks that originated from hospitals and schoolyards. In Operation Iraqi Freedom, US soldiers confronted an enemy that hid weapons in mosques, hospitals, and schools and wore civilian clothing to avoid destruction. Operational commanders will continue to face these types of threats regardless of the type of operation they undertake: Offense, Defense, Stability, or Support. The tendency for belligerent actors to avoid open area conflict with the United States will certainly increase. These approaches are intended to offset America's strength and intended to attack America's weakness. With the increase of asymmetric attacks and the potential of the proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) to rogue actors, where does this leave the United States' strategy of nuclear and conventional deterrence? Is the US Army capable in playing a deterrent role against these threats? This study examines the doctrinal definition of deterrence, reviews Bernard Brodie's deterrence theory and discusses the impacts of his theory upon state and nonstate actors. The study further defines the terms asymmetry and asymmetrical threats and reviews a World View Threat survey (European and American) that identifies these asymmetrical threats as Islamic fundamentalists. Additionally, the study presents the ends, ways, and means utilized by the Union Army during the Civil War, and the ends, ways, means utilized by the US Army during operations in Bosnia in order to deter asymmetrical threats. The study concludes by presenting operational commanders with five principles for consideration when designing campaign plans against asymmetrical threats.",

      "description": "The global war on terrorism has provided a new context for relations between the United States and China. As the September 2002 National Security Strategy of the United States of America makes clear, cooperation with China on a range of economic, political, security, and military issues increasingly serves U.S. interests. At the same time, this relationship retains elements of competition and the potential for confrontation, compounded by a legacy of periodic crises and mutual wariness. Achieving a national consensus on an appropriate balance in U.S.-China relations, especially in military-to-military affairs, remains a central challenge for those who analyze, formulate, and implement America's China policies. The distinguished contributors to this volume offer fresh and sometimes divergent assessments of major trends in Chinese society, national security policy, and military affairs as the fourth generation of national leaders settles into the seats of power. Part I considers the political and military transitions in China during 2002-2003 and their implications for Chinese civil-military relations and U.S. foreign and defense policy. Part II examines the impact of growing nationalism on Chinese politics and the People's Liberation Army (PLA). Understanding the PLA role in Chinese society requires consideration of PLA doctrine, strategy, and force structure, so Part III provides critical assessments of current and projected capabilities that are essential for informed speculation about future intentions. Part IV examines China's national security concept and military doctrine and strategy to understand the main determinants of military planning and operations. Part V assesses the record and prospects for U.S.- China military-to-military relations. Finally, Part VI advances two divergent paths for U.S.-China relations.",

      "description": "In July of last year, the Bush administration published the National Strategy for Homeland Security (NSHS) which, while commendable in many ways, failed to take into account the effects of globalization in planning for the nation's security. Safeguarding America's homeland in an era of globalization requires a more comprehensive approach based on a global defense-in-depth. The NSHS amounts to little more than a strategic directive for the newly formed Department of Homeland Security (DHS), rather than a national strategy. It focuses principally on activities that take place within the nation's borders, making only a brief genuflection to the need for international cooperation. Other than a passing reference to Northern Command and its envisioned responsibilities in civil support, the NSHS fails to address the roles that the U.S. military's combatant commands should play. Finally, the NSHS fails to incorporate newly emerging technologies into an overarching strategic concept, or way, that would contribute to keeping Americans safe.",

      "description": "In 1961, Bernard Fall, a scholar and practitioner of war, published a book entitled The Street Without Joy. The book provided a lucid account of why the French Expeditionary Corps failed to defeat the Viet Minh during the Indochina War, and the book's title derived from the French soldiers' sardonic moniker for Highway 1 on the coast of Indochina -- Ambush Alley, or the Street without Joy. In 2003, after the fall of Baghdad and following the conventional phase of Operation Iraqi Freedom, U.S. and Coalition forces operating in the Sunni Triangle began fighting a counterguerrilla type war in which much of the enemy insurgent activity occurred along Highway 1, another street exhibiting little joy. The U.S. military has had a host of successful experiences in counterguerrilla war, including some distinct successes with certain aspects of the Vietnam War. However, the paradox stemming from America's unsuccessful crusade in the jungles of Vietnam is this -- because the experience was perceived as anathema to the mainstream American military, hard lessons learned there about fighting guerrillas were neither embedded nor preserved in the U.S. Army's institutional memory. Since the U.S. Army and its coalition partners are currently prosecuting counterguerrilla wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, it is useful to revisit the lessons from Vietnam and other counterinsurgencies because they are germane to the wars of today and tomorrow. This article aims to distill some of the more relevant counterinsurgency lessons from the American military's experiences during Vietnam and before. A bigger goal of the article, however, is to highlight some salient studies for professional reading as the U.S. Army starts to inculcate a mindset that embraces the challenges of counterinsurgency and to develop a culture that learns from past lessons in counterinsurgency.",

      "description": "Drinking water system security concerns have been a considerable issue in the United States in recent years, but in the last two years this issue has risen to new levels of urgency. The tragic events of September 11th highlighted America's vulnerability to terrorism and spurred a domestic security response unprecedented since World War II. Currently, significant purposeful contamination of a water system won't be properly characterized until post-symptomatic epidemiological events are manifested in the affected community. One approach to mitigating this potential disaster includes on-line monitoring of drinking water distribution systems. Four credible threat chemical drinking water contaminants (aldicarb, sodium arsenate, sodium cyanide, and sodium fluoroacetate) were analyzed at different concentrations to determine their detectability in a drinking water distribution system using commonly measured parameters. On-line monitoring that measured conductivity, pH, chlorine residual, turbidity, and total organic carbon was completed to determine baseline water quality indicators. The contaminants were then mixed with tap water and analyzed in beakers to determine their contaminant- instrument response at various concentrations with bench top instruments. This data was then used to determine dosing into a bench scale distribution system. The contaminants were then added at the specified concentrations to determine detectability using the on-line monitoring equipment. Results indicate that the four chemical contaminants can be detected at relatively low concentrations with routine monitoring.",

      "description": "After World War II, America was forced to reevaluate its prewar continentalist vision of security strategy. A globalist consensus soon emerged as the United States found itself in a position similar to Great Britain in 1815. As U.S. grand strategy became more formal and the realities of the Cold War set in, America's leadership began to meet the Soviet challenge on all levels of national power. The resultant Cold War security strategy forged new alliances and in some cases pressured relatively neutral countries into making tough decisions. A country's willingness to sign up to a U.S.-led security strategy could ultimately weaken its own political stability in a domestic as well as regional context. The global nature of American foreign policy and how it is perceived by smaller nations is the impetus for many of the second-order effects and consequences associated with foreign policy choices. In many cases these devastating effects are predictable, but are nonetheless deemed acceptable when placed within the larger scheme of international relations. Some may argue that the outcomes are justified for their service to the common good of the international community. This paper examines the security strategy of the United States during the Cold War as well as the contemporary setting of the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT). Within this context, the paper argues that the second-order effects of U.S. Cold War strategy experienced by Lebanon in the 195Os ultimately contributed to the root causes of its Civil War in 1958. Similarly, the paper looks to present-day security strategies wed to the GWOT and suggests how second-order effects may lead to equally disastrous consequences for Pakistan. To what degree should the United States concern itself with these effects and make a conscious decision to mitigate them before they begin to threaten a smaller country's stability? If ignored, can the escalation of these consequences weaken U.S. security interests in a region? (43 re7",

      "description": "The terrorist attacks of September 11th, 2001, marked a watershed event for America. No longer can it be expected that the American military will fight our nations battles on foreign lands while America's populace is safe back in the homeland. Now, the new frontlines of this War on Terrorism are defined by where and when an attack happens; the new soldiers are America's first responders. Unfortunately, as 9-11 demonstrated, these new frontline warriors do not fully possess the tools, training, or most importantly, the interoperability that their military counterparts have perfected over the past several decades. Among these tools, communications capability represents the most important force multiplier on the battlefield. For the first responder, communications capability is absolutely essential. One emerging communications and data-sharing tool that can greatly empower first responders, and provide them with greater situational awareness and decision superiority, is Peer-to-Peer Technology (P2P). P2P technology allows two or more computers to establish direct contact without a central entity. Such technology provides a rapidly established, flexible, and dynamic architecture. Moreover, it provides a robust, reliable, and distributed information-sharing capability for homeland security applications. US Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) represents the Department of Defense's operational command for Homeland Security. One of its key missions is to provide military assistance to civil authorities, including consequence management operations during terrorist attacks. This research will explore and advocate using Peer-to-Peer(P2P) technology within USNORTHCOM and Homeland Security architectures to enable the creation of an interoperable, flexible, and robust communications and datasharing network. The primary objective of this research is to determine how P2P technology can improve homeland security crisis-response elements to benefit first responders and their agencies. 7",

      "description": "Over one hundred and eighty thousand black men fought for the Union during America's Civil War. From infantrymen, to artillerist and cavalry soldiers, these soldiers combined to form one hundred and sixty-six Union regiments. On 29 October 1862 at Island Mound, Missouri, the First Kansas Colored Volunteers, an infantry regiment comprised mainly of blacks from Kansas and Missouri, became the first black regiment to experience combat during the Civil War. Their courage and outstanding performance in battle, as recorded, are unquestioned. What have been omitted from research thus far are their contributions to overall Union successes in the Trans-Mississippi West. Their accomplishments are remarkable, for they came in the face of extreme obstacles of prejudice and hatred. No Quarter was ever given and No Quarter was asked of the regiment s black soldiers. The contributions of the First Kansas Colored Volunteers, in conjunction with those of the many regiments they served along side of, resulted in a resounding Union victory in the Trans-Mississippi West.",

      "description": "In American academe today the dominant view of civil-military relations is sternly critical of the military, asserting that civilian control of the military is dangerously eroded. Though tension clearly exists in the relationship, the current critique is largely inaccurate and badly overwrought. Far from overstepping its bounds, America's military operates comfortably within constitutional notions of separated powers, participating appropriately in defense and national security policymaking with due deference to the principle of civilian control. Indeed, an active and vigorous role by the military in the policy process is and always has been essential to the common defense. A natural starting point for any inquiry into the state of civil-military relations in the US today is to define what is meant by the terms civil-military relations and civilian control. Broadly defined, civil-military relations refers to the relationship between the armed forces of the state and the larger society they serve how they communicate, how they interact, and how the interface between them is ordered and regulated. Similarly, civilian control means simply the degree to which the military's civilian masters can enforce their authority on the military services. Clarifying the vocabulary of civil-military relations sheds an interesting light on the current, highly charged debate. The dominant academic critique takes several forms, charging that the military has become increasingly estranged from the society it serves; that it has abandoned political neutrality for partisan politics; and that it plays an increasingly dominant and illegitimate role in policymaking. This view contrasts the ideal of the nonpartisan, apolitical soldier with a different reality. In this construct, the military operates freely in a charged political environment to impose its own perspective in defiance of the principle of civilian control.",

      "description": "Throughout American history, the bulk of U.S. military forces fighting during the nation's major wars at least through the end of the 19th Century were men who volunteered for state militia units, whether organized or unorganized. The currently existing state defense forces are the direct descendent organizations of such traditional American militias. For national or homeland defense, the U.S. military has always relied upon these militias, which are groups of part-timers assembled for contingencies. This article describes the structure and missions of state defense forces or state militias during and after the Civil War, World War I, World War II, the Korean War, the Vietnam War, and the Cold War, and after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks.",

      "description": "This article analyzes the Supreme Court's judicial review over military tribunals to identify the constitutional limits of military courts within America's system of government. The central thesis is that the Supreme Court's review over military courts has failed to coherently define the boundary between federal courts and military tribunals. Rather than creating a consistent precedent, the Court's decisions have led to arbitrary results and an increased uncertainty about whether the military commissions at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, are constitutional. This article seeks to remedy this problem by proposing a method of constitutional interpretation that creates a principled distinction between the cases that belong in federal court and those matters properly before military tribunals. First, it lays the groundwork by defining the four different types of military tribunals and examining the nature of Supreme Court review over military courts. Next, it examines the historic use of military courts and looks at each instance of Supreme Court review over these military tribunals. Finally, it critiques the Court's textualist interpretation of the Constitution and demonstrates how translation theory provides a more effective method of defining the boundaries of military courts. It concludes by explaining why the current trial of Salim Hamdan by military commission is unconstitutional under translation theory.",

Homosexual activists want their sexual lifestyles to be a civil right, but did you know that they seek to silence the truth about homosexuality and abolish moral judgment in any form? The Agenda takes you inside the culture war, exposing the shocking methods of the \"gay\" campaign and the strategies homosexual activists are employing to transform American society radically. Rev. Louis P. Sheldon, a prominent voice exposing the homosexual rights movement for thirty-three years, reveals their agenda and how it impacts Christianity, the business community, public schools, the church, and the media. Discover the powerful answers to these thought-provoking questions:\n- How and when did the homosexual movement get started?\n- How did militant homosexual activists force the American Psychiatric Association to abandon its official policy that classified same-sex attraction as a mental disorder?\n- How have the resources of the public health system and funds designated for AIDS research been co-opted by homosexual activists to promote their lifestyle to America's children?\n- Why is same-sex marriage a bad idea?You can help restore the moral fabric of the nation.\nThis timely book will inform and motivate you to get involved in stopping the radical transformation of American culture and protecting future generations from the destructive forces of the homosexual agenda.</small>\n\nNotes: \n<small>- the TOC's been rebuilt, footnotes linked & the layout of chapter headings slightly modified. \n- includes custom background (if theres no preview) and footnotes are colored white (for contrast), so wont be compatible with e-readers that change the text and background colors</small>",

Since that day, many officials have attempted to reshape the way the American government protects its citizens. This paper reviews two critical issues that can redefine how the Navy and Coast Guard will fight the Global War on Terror as a team. The first analyzes the contrasting relationship between homeland security and homeland defense. The second analyzes existing operational command structures used by the Navy and the Coast Guard. The paper will illustrate in both cases that existing schools of thought have unintentionally created cognitive barriers that have prevented the nation's maritime services from working effectively as a team. In response, the paper provides two new concepts that may help operational commanders unite the services to fulfill their common missions.",

They must build and maintain U.S. defenses beyond challenge. As part of the total military force and to comply with the National Security Strategy, the National Guard also must transform from the Guard of the past to the Guard of the future. This is imperative to the security of the nation and the state, and to the very relevance of the National Guard itself. This research paper analyzes the current organization of the Guard force down to the lowest level, determines its strategic effectiveness, and discusses how it should change its current organization to meet the transformation needs of the future total force. To be more ready, reliable, essential, and accessible, it must re-balance its forces worldwide. It must organize, train, equip, and resource its units like its active component counterparts with light formations and growth in areas such as Military Police and Information Operations. This growth and conversion will help the National Guard to better respond to homeland defense and security missions, many times in lieu of active component forces. Further, Weapons of Mass Destruction Civil Support Teams must continue and must be enhanced with full-time assets to better support local civil authorities. The National Guard's role in Northern Command needs to continue to grow and develop as a vital link to defense in the homeland. The Northern Command's use of the National Guard enhances the active component force's ability to conduct homeland defense and warfighting missions abroad as necessary.",

      "description": "Protocol I to the famous 1949 Geneva Conventions expanded the protection afforded to victims of international armed conflicts, incorporating a wide range of provisions regarding protection of the wounded and sick, methods and means of warfare, and protection of the civilian population and civilian objects from dangers arising from hostilities. The United States signed the accord in December of 1977, but soon after, Protocol I become a lightning rod of controversy for some domestic critics. This paper will show that it is in America's best interests to revisit her decision to reject Protocol I, and if possible, to ratify it. But even failing that as a realistic option, the United States should and must make clear its position on the Protocol, openly embracing and supporting those provisions which codify existing customary international law or constitute positive developments in the Law of War, while specifically noting which articles it finds objectionable, and laying out a sound, reasonably articulable basis for those objections. Doing so will enhance U.S. relations and military operations with its closest allies, provide its own military forces the clear and understandable guidance they need, and secure a crucial opportunity for the United States to take a leading role in the advancement of international humanitarian law.",

In the 230-year history of the Navy, the Naval Reserve has only been organized for the last 90 years. This paper examines the history of the Navy, identifying key elements within the United States that lead to the authorization of the Naval Reserve in 1916. It examines the political, economic, and strategic environment in the United States between 1775 and 1916, and looks at the strategic mission of the Navy and how it changed during that time to require a ready reserve. The experiences of naval leaders over time formed the basis of the theory behind the inclusion of a viable reserve force. The gradual recognition of the changing and expanding role of the Navy after the Industrial Revolution, the culmination of America's Manifest Destiny, and the development of a strategic naval policy, along with overseas territorial expansion, all provided the social and political impetus that led to the authorization of the U.S. Naval Reserve. The U.S. Naval Reserve continues to provide valuable support to the Navy. Both are continuing to transform to maintain the relevance between the forces.",

      "description": "Several external powers, fearing the consequences of American success, while also sensing American weakness, have maneuvered to gain advantage in the current conflict and hedge against a potential lack of US resolve. A number of Sunni Arab states, particularly Saudi Arabia and Syria, have provided support, directly or indirectly, to the Sunni insurgent movement and the jihadists. They are concerned that fellow Sunni Arabs in Iraq may reap the whirlwind they have sewn over decades through their persecution of the Shiites and Kurds. The Saudis also fear that American fecklessness will lead to a premature withdrawal of US troops, leaving Iraq in a state of civil war between Sunnis and Shiites. Neither Syria nor Saudi Arabia wants to see an Iranian- dominated Iraq emerge from such a conflict. They also fear US success, which might lead to a democratic Iraq whose gains might lead other Arabs/Muslims to challenge their own despotic regimes. Thus the frontline Sunni Arab states are hedging against the possibility that the Iran-Iraq war may be refought, only this time in within Iraq as opposed to along its borders. In short, in a part of the world where strength and resolve are respected and weakness and vacillation exploited, the perception of US fecklessness has a compounding negative effect. It both discourages America's potential allies in this war, and encourages its enemies. This works to further undermine the US public's resolve and may, over time, deplete the US military's morale. It appears the American people do not appreciate how high the stakes are in this conflict. Iraq may have begun as a war of choice; however, it has become a war of necessity. The costs of failure in Iraq are likely to be high-much higher than was incurred following the US withdrawal from Haiti, Somalia, Lebanon or even Vietnam.",

      "description": "Current U.S. military transformation strategy centers on information dominance, network-centric warfare, and expeditionary operations. Certainly, adversaries learned from Saddam's poor decision to face American forces head-on and will increasingly employ asymmetric attacks to defeat U.S. forces in the future. Electromagnetic pulse (EMP) weapons represent one of the most likely and potentially devastating opportunities for this type of attack in the near future. Ranging from sophisticated intercontinental nuclear weapons specifically designed to generate EMP effects to relatively crude and cheap electromagnetic bombs, these weapons can destroy all electronic devices within a target area as small as an automobile or as large as the continental United States. As U.S. forces continue to modernize and rely on electronic systems, it will become increasingly probable that an adversary will use EMP to strike at America's Achilles heel. This paper addresses the threat EMP weapons will pose to U.S. expeditionary operations in the near future. It begins by discussing the nature of EMP and its effect on vulnerable systems, and then outlines the different methods of generating EMP while categorizing them by probability of use, lethal range, types of (electronic) targets they affect, and who is likely to use them. The paper considers three near-term scenarios for adversary use of EMP and recommends cost-effective response measures. It proposes a diplomatic policy to levy drastic consequences on the perpetrator of an EMP attack, rapid establishment of an EMP-hardened expeditionary force, hardening critical elements of civil infrastructures, integration of EMP attack response in large-scale training scenarios, and congressional action to establish and mandate compliance with EMP hardening standards for future military and civilian systems.",

      "description": "Since the terrorist attacks of 11 September 2001, the United States has conducted a new type of war. This war is taking place all across the globe, but most importantly it is being fought in the coffee shops, mosques, and living rooms of Muslims. The war is not going to be won in the physical realm, in which most of America's war fighters are comfortable. The strategic corporal/strategic captain concept is not longer a cliche; it is a reality. The saying demonstrates how actions at the tactical level of war impact the operational and strategic levels of war. Today's wars are complex and require innovation and an understanding of how tactical actions have strategic consequences. Commanders at the tactical level must be able to apply all the elements of national power to effectively target the conditions that foster and perpetuate an insurgency. In an insurgency, there is a segment of the population that provides various degrees of support to the insurgents. If not outright support in the form of money, safe harbor, and a sympathetic blind eye, this segment of the population may simply tolerate the existence and activity of the insurgent. Influence over this group of fence sitters, often described as the target audience (TA), must be the primary objective of all military operations to include information operations, civilian-military operations, government support operations, and security operations. Based on emerging threats, the United States is in danger of finding itself the only one who still fights a regular war. Because of the nature of future wars, the ability of the tactical commander to fight beyond the physical realm will determine success. The tactical commander's ability to employ nontraditional methods will be the difference between operational success or never-ending insurgency.",

NAEP measures the U.S. history knowledge and skills of students in grades 4, 8, and 12. According to the NAEP U.S. history framework, the assessment should be organized around three dimensions: historical themes, chronological periods, and ways of knowing and thinking about U.S. history. Four historical themes, intended to cover all major branches of historical study are the core organizing structure of the framework: (1) Change and continuity in American democracy: ideas, institutions, events, key figures, and controversies; (2) Gathering and interactions of peoples, cultures, and ideas; (3) Economic and technological changes and their relation to society, ideas, and the environment; and (4) America's changing role in the world. Eight at-times overlapping chronological periods were used in developing the assessment, focusing attention on several major eras of U.S. history: (1) Beginnings to 1607; (2) Colonization, settlement, and communities (1607 to 1763); (3) Revolution and the new nation (1763 to 1815); (4) Expansion and reform (1801 to 1861); (5) Crisis of the Union: Civil War and Reconstruction (1850 to 1877); (6) Development of modern America (1865 to 1920);(7) Modern America and the World Wars (1914 to 1945); and (8) Contemporary America (1945 to present). Two cognitive domains of knowing and thinking were used as a guide to develop questions: (1) Historical knowledge and perspective: includes knowing and understanding people, events, concepts, themes, movements, contexts, and historical sources; sequencing events; recognizing multiple perspectives and seeing an era or movement through the eyes of different groups; and developing a general conceptualization of U.S. history; and (2) Historical analysis and interpretation: includes explaining issues, identifying historical patterns; establishing cause-and-effect relationships; finding value statements; establishing significance; applying historical knowledge; weighing evidence to draw sound conclusions; making defensible generalizations; and rendering insightful accounts of the past. The report contains 2 appendixes: (1) NAEP U.S. History Framework Project; and (2) Released Items from the NAEP U.S. History Assessment. (Contains 5 tables.)

      "description": "The Army has learned a great deal in Iraq and Afghanistan about the conduct of counterinsurgency operations, and we must continue to learn all that we can from our experiences in those countries. The insurgencies in Iraq and Afghanistan were not, in truth, the wars for which we were best prepared in 2001; however, they are the wars we are fighting and they clearly are the kind of wars we must master. America's overwhelming conventional military superiority makes it unlikely that future enemies will confront us head on. Rather, they will attack us asymmetrically, avoiding our strengths -- firepower, maneuver, technology -- and come at us and our partners the way the insurgents do in Iraq and Afghanistan. It is imperative, therefore, that we continue to learn from our experiences in those countries, both to succeed in those endeavors and to prepare for the future. Writing down observations and lessons learned is a time-honored tradition of Soldiers. In an effort to foster learning as an organization, the Army institutionalized the process of collection, evaluation, and dissemination of observations, insights, and lessons some 20 years ago with the formation of the Center for Army Lessons Learned. In subsequent years, the other military services and the Joint Forces Command followed suit, forming their own lessons learned centers. More recently, the Internet and other knowledge-management tools have sped the processes of collection, evaluation, and dissemination enormously. In this article, the author presents the distillation of 14 observations that he recorded while serving as Commander of the 101st Airborne Division and then Commander of the Multi-National Security Transition Command-Iraq and the NATO Training Mission-Iraq during the first 2-1/2 years of U.S. involvement in Iraq.",

      "description": "<p>Taylor Branch has referred to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. as a modern American founding father. Over the past twenty five years, Taylor Branch has written three volumes dedicated to the life of Dr. King. The first two books in this trilogy won just about every major literary award possible, including the Pulitzer Prize. Taylor will be at Microsoft Research discussing his third and final volume on Dr. King\u2019s life and work At Canaan's Edge. He portrays King at the height of his moral power even as his worldly power is waning. It shows why Dr. King\u2019s fidelity to freedom and nonviolence makes him a defining figure long beyond his brilliant life and violent end.</p><p>In At Canaan's Edge, King and his movement stand at the zenith of America's defining story, one decade into an epic struggle for the promises of democracy. Branch opens with the authorities' violent suppression of a voting-rights march in Alabama on March 7, 1965. The quest to cross Selma's Edmund Pettus Bridge engages the conscience of the world, strains the civil rights coalition, and embroils King in negotiations with all three branches of the U.S. government.</p><p>Freedom workers are murdered, but sharecroppers learn to read, dare to vote, and build their own political party. Also after Selma, King takes nonviolence into Northern urban ghettoes. Integrated marches through Chicago expose hatreds and fears no less virulent than the Mississippi Klan's, but King's 1966 settlement with Mayor Richard Daley does not gain the kind of national response that generated victories from Birmingham and Selma. We watch King overrule his advisers to bring all his eloquence into dissent from the Vietnam War. We watch King make an embattled decision to concentrate his next campaign on a positive compact to address poverty. We reach Memphis, the garbage workers' strike, and King's assassination.</p><div class=\"fs30\">\u00a92006 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.</div>",

      "description": "<p>Taylor Branch has referred to Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. as a modern American founding father. Over the past twenty five years, Taylor Branch has written three volumes dedicated to the life of Dr. King. The first two books in this trilogy won just about every major literary award possible, including the Pulitzer Prize. Taylor will be at Microsoft Research discussing his third and final volume on Dr. King\u2019s life and work At Canaan's Edge. He portrays King at the height of his moral power even as his worldly power is waning. It shows why Dr. King\u2019s fidelity to freedom and nonviolence makes him a defining figure long beyond his brilliant life and violent end.</p><p>In At Canaan's Edge, King and his movement stand at the zenith of America's defining story, one decade into an epic struggle for the promises of democracy. Branch opens with the authorities' violent suppression of a voting-rights march in Alabama on March 7, 1965. The quest to cross Selma's Edmund Pettus Bridge engages the conscience of the world, strains the civil rights coalition, and embroils King in negotiations with all three branches of the U.S. government.</p><p>Freedom workers are murdered, but sharecroppers learn to read, dare to vote, and build their own political party. Also after Selma, King takes nonviolence into Northern urban ghettoes. Integrated marches through Chicago expose hatreds and fears no less virulent than the Mississippi Klan's, but King's 1966 settlement with Mayor Richard Daley does not gain the kind of national response that generated victories from Birmingham and Selma. We watch King overrule his advisers to bring all his eloquence into dissent from the Vietnam War. We watch King make an embattled decision to concentrate his next campaign on a positive compact to address poverty. We reach Memphis, the garbage workers' strike, and King's assassination.</p><div class=\"fs30\">\u00a92006 Microsoft Corporation. All rights reserved.</div>",

      "description": "Increasing Islamic extremist terrorist attacks against primarily Christian worship sites in the Middle East and Southeast Asia pose disturbing questions: Could terrorists attack places of worship or a religious icon in America, what security policies are currently in effect, and what would be the impact on the American People? This paper explores the potential consequences of neglecting the security of religious venues in America and how it could have strategic ramifications if ignored. Could a successful and highly visible terrorist attack on an American worship site have such an effect on the American Public that it could drastically alter the war on terror, re-draw battle lines by faith, and launch a modern day Crusades? What role does the federal government currently have in defending America's religious venues against the threat of an Islamic extremist terrorist attack? Are current security efforts adequate, and if not, what policies or new approach should be taken? The author ultimately proposes a federally-led layered security engagement strategy model for religious venues. This model utilizes an incentive-based federal resourcing approach to facilitate achieving optimal security while still preserving America's core social tenet of protecting and ensuring the religious freedoms of its citizenry from religiously-motivated Islamist terrorism.",

      "description": "Fourth Generation Warfare (4GW) requires more than just superior technology, firepower, and stand-off capability. Fighting a 4GW adversary requires boots on the ground, functional language and cultural awareness to facilitate the collection of actionable intelligence, the ability to know when and how to go kinetic, and more importantly, when to show restraint and patience. The training of friendly indigenous forces, initiation of civil affairs projects to restore and improve living conditions, and building relationships with locals are significant factors in the effort to win the hearts and minds campaign. However, gaining all-important language skills and cultural awareness is a challenge facing U.S. military forces, and the subject of this paper. Until recently, when language and cultural awareness training occurred, it was limited, conducted just in time prior to deployment, and followed by on-site orientation and on-the-job training in theater. The Army Special Operations school has long recognized the value of more rigorous, extended language and culture training. Other long-term language and culture training initiatives have been announced by the President to help address the needs of the long war. Whether such efforts will provide sufficient language and cultural expertise in the U.S. military is open to debate. There is another source of these skills, however, if the military can just can tap into it. America's melting pot should provide a sufficiently large talent pool with the requisite language and cultural skills -- the military just needs to take steps to maximize its ability to recruit from it. This paper examines the need for language and cultural proficiency in the U.S. military, the effectiveness of current efforts to gain relevant language and cultural skills, long-term strategies proposed by the current Administration, and the prospects for and potential barriers to their success.",

      "description": "The National Military Strategic Plan for the War on Terrorism (NMSP), released by the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff on February 1, 2006, sets out the Pentagon's broad strategy for executing, and presumably winning, the Global War on Terrorism (GWOT). The NMSP can be viewed as an elaboration of part of the larger and more holistic set of policies spelled out by the Department of Defense (DoD) in its June 2005 Strategy for Homeland Defense and Civil Support. The latter envisions a layered approach towards homeland defense and security based on a distinction between the following: Forward Regions, Approaches to the United States, the U.S. Homeland, and the Global Commons (space and cyberspace). Although the NMSP does not specifically position itself within the rubric of the larger June 2005 strategy paper, its focus on attacking terrorist networks abroad, strengthening international governance, and creating a global environment inhospitable to terrorists suggest that it should be viewed as a DoD articulation of the Forward Regions component of the overall strategy. The NMSP's primary flaw is that it sets out policy goals that are highly impractical and ultimately largely unachievable. In so doing, it will not only embolden America's enemies when the United States invariably fails to achieve those policy goals, but also will create unrealistic expectations among allies and the American public. The danger here is that not meeting those expectations will create a sense that the government and military are losing the war on terrorism because central policy goals set out by the military are not being met. In sum, the NMSP should be just that: a military strategy, not a political, economic, or social one. The U.S. military can fight terrorists in the traditional sense of the term. By setting this as its true policy goal, the Pentagon will be creating a goal that is achievable.",

      "description": "Four years into the war in Iraq, the debate rages over whether there are enough troops deployed to accomplish the mission. Congress and the White House continuously argue over resources and the conduct of the war. Meanwhile, American and Iraqi casualties persist at an unacceptable rate. America's political and military leaders suggest progress is being made and we should stay the course; after all, it generally requires 8 to 10 years to defeat an insurgency. From a historical perspective, they are correct. But the situation in Iraq is not just an insurgency, and labeling it as such is a gross oversimplification of the challenges we face. Iraq is a mega-complex challenge; a collage of complex issues that cannot be readily deconstructed into individual issues and problems, solved, and put back together. Every issue in Iraq has potential second- and third-order effects as well as unintended consequences. Some of the enduring factors that will not be easily resolved are the deep-rooted religious conflict, modernization, corruption, inequitable distribution of wealth, lack of economic development, discontent among young males, the prevalence of militias, and a divided government influenced by sectarian interests. Understanding these issues is essential to comprehending the overall nature of the war. The current situation in Iraq is the result of three fundamental strategic mistakes. First, the United States, particularly its military, initially was remiss in discerning the nature of the conflict and subsequently failed to reassess the situation as circumstances evolved. Second, the government, as a whole, failed to balance ends, ways, and means. Third, the government chose the wrong strategy. Instead of adopting a strategy appropriate for the complexities of a multifaceted conflict that includes elements of civil war, insurgency, and terrorism, decisionmakers instituted a strategy predominantly focused on counterinsurgency operations.",

Subsequent efforts to establish security and implement post-conflict stabilization in Iraq have proven to be the far greater challenge. America's extended campaign to stabilize and secure Iraq, complicated by an insurgency and civil war, has strained our nation's all volunteer force and led to extensive use of the National Guard as an operational - rather than a strategic - reserve. This shift has serious implications for the future roles, force structure, and missions of the Army National Guard. This paper reviews the historical roles of the National Guard and the challenges of becoming an operational reserve; examines pitfalls to implementing modularity and ARFORGEN (Army Forces Generation) in the guard; and outlines the impact of transformation on National Guard state mission execution and civil support.",

      "description": "The fall of the Soviet Union left America as the primary leader of an increasingly interdependent world of nations in a dynamic international security environment characterized by volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity. This paper proposes a structural solution to improving the Nation's ability to respond, and stay engaged for as long as it takes, in simultaneous Stability, Security, Transition and Reconstruction Operations (SSTRO) worldwide. The proposed solution employs the right resources against five key SSTR lines of operations: diplomacy, information, economics, security, and development. It focuses U.S. armed forces on full-spectrum military proficiency, while providing a robust, rapidly employable interagency capability to address non-combat SSTR tasks. A new Department of International Development (DID) greatly improves national and regional integration and synchronization of U.S. Government (USG), International Organization, Non-governmental Organization, and Private Volunteer Organization efforts in SSTR areas. Lastly, this proposal provides interagency depth, breadth, and responsiveness for SSTRO with full-time and reserve civil support organizations possessing comprehensive nation-assistance skills, forward-positioned in each Geographic Component Command (GCC) region. Until a U.S. SSTR structural improvement is made, the U.S. Armed Forces, as it has done for many years, will continue to represent Americans proudly overseas executing whatever assignments the Nation deems necessary.",

      "description": "This thesis covers a period of transformation in the Army between a large Civil War Army armed primarily with muzzle-loading percussion arms to an Army numbering in the tens of thousands armed with magazine-fed, bolt-action repeating rifles. The thesis covers the boards, trials, procedures, and political and economic constraints that were involved in selecting new arms during this period as well as the specific arms that were considered and selected. The paper concludes with an analysis of the decisions made and how similar considerations affect decisions regarding the small arms carried by America's soldiers today.",
